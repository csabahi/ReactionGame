## Introduction

Welcome to the OpenCV Hand Reaction Game! This simple Python game uses OpenCV and CVZone to detect your hand and challenges you to click on a moving circle as quickly as possible. It's a fun way to test your reaction time and hand-eye coordination.

This project was utilized for conducting an experiment aimed at measuring reaction times. The experiment encompassed a total of 100 iterations, during which data was collected. Subsequently, this data was employed in a statistical analysis to assess its distribution alonsigde its variables, to determine whether it conforms to a normal distribution. 

## Prerequisites

Before you start playing the game, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.10
- OpenCV (cv2) library
- A webcam or camera connected to your computer
